PROJECT MARANTA.KZ(EXAMPLE3)

THREE MAIN PROBLEMS 
1. Theres are no names of students who developed them.
2. In all pages they didn't describe the action mechanisms  or mark them which makes the screen appear.
3. On screen "Home page for users from Turkey" and screen  "Home page for users from Kazakhstan" there is a button called "Archieve",
which has description but has no screen related to this button's action(like , where it leads).


1. To share the main project look between team members  and the customer.
2. Easier to recognize the mistakes ,  недоработки at early stages.
